Hey, I just covered the dinner for the usual gang—₹2400 total. Split it like we always do.
Lunch was ₹1200 today. Everyone was there except Jordan, so don't charge him.
I paid ₹800 for snacks for the trip. Alex and Sam owe me their halves.
Dinner tonight was ₹3000, but that includes Sam’s extra dessert for ₹400, so handle that first.
Coffee for the group was ₹600, but only me and Jordan actually had anything.
Just sent ₹1500 for food. Use the same distribution we used for the mountain trip.
Jordan paid for the cab today, just like he did last time we went out.
Split the ₹2000 for groceries. It's the same breakdown as before.
I just paid ₹1000 for the tickets. Adjust the balance based on what happened yesterday.
Sent ₹750 to Prasi to clear my debt from the weekend.

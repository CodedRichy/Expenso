# Expenso Product North Star

**The one-line truth:**

> "I want my money back — without asking."

---

## The Real Pain

Not expense tracking. Not bill splitting. Not typing faster.

Those are mechanics. This is human psychology.

**Money + relationships collide.**

When you ask:
- You look cheap
- You look desperate
- You risk tension
- You risk silence

When you don't ask:
- You lose money
- You resent people
- You stop paying next time

That's a lose–lose loop. People hate this loop more than they hate losing ₹300.

---

## Why Splitwise Doesn't Fully Solve This

Splitwise still makes you:
- Add expenses
- Send reminders
- Ping individuals
- Explain balances

So even with Splitwise: **You're still the bad guy.**

## Expenso's Idea Is Different

> "The system asks. Not you."

That's a fundamentally different emotional contract.

## Product Behavior Principles

| Do This | Not This |
|---------|----------|
| Group reminders | Individual pings |
| Neutral language | "X owes Y" |
| Cycles | Constant chasing |
| Authority lives in the system | Authority lives in the person |
| Payments feel routine | Payments feel confrontational |

## The Test

If someone asks "why Expenso?" the answer is:

> "So I never have to personally ask for money again."

If the app ever drifts away from this, it's wrong.

---

## Decision Filter

Before adding any feature, ask:

1. Does this make the user feel like they're asking for money?
2. Does this put names/blame front and center?
3. Does this make payments feel personal instead of routine?

If yes to any → don't build it, or redesign it.

*Lock this in your head. Everything we build must serve this.*

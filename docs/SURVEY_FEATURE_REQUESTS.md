# Survey feature requests (user research)

**Source:** Expenso App Idea — Reducing Shared Money Awkwardness (Form Responses).  
**When:** Jan 26–28, 2026. Real responses (~40).

Question asked: *“If this app existed today, what is the one feature you would most want in it?”*

Below are the requested features, grouped by theme for product/backlog reference.

---

## Reminders & notifications

- **Reminder on the day of the shared expense** so the person who owes is prompted.
- **Reminders** (mentioned multiple times).
- **Regular reminder system** if someone doesn’t pay.
- **Reminders sent by the app at fixed cycles** so no one has to personally ask for money.
- **Gentle reminders.**
- **System-generated, group-first reminders** so no individual has to chase money.
- **A timer for payments and timely notifications.**
- **Group chat with timely reminders** of how much you owe.
- **Automatic deadline based on amount** (e.g. if it’s ₹500, give them 4 days).

*Verdict:* Strong signal. Aligns with “no one feels like the money police” and planned **Smart “nudge” templates** in APP_BLUEPRINT §9.1.

## Settlement & “no awkwardness”

- **Track who owes what and settle by itself** without conversation with the person.
- **Equal settlement without hurting anyone.**
- **“I paid, don’t worry about it”** — option to clear it from group expense (forgive/write-off).
- **How the app lets a group agree on when money gets settled** (per trip, weekly, monthly) — clarity on cycles.

*Verdict:* Core to Expenso (cycles, group-first). “I paid, don’t worry” is a concrete UX ask; consider as a settlement action.

---

## Tracking & history

- **Keep track of financial transactions / expenses.**
- **Final report with all the expenses.**
- **Something like bank statement or history.**
- **Input expenses: name, date, amount** (basic expense tracking — already in app).
- **Keep track of expense** (generic).

*Verdict:* Report/statement/history supports **Cycle history** and future “export” or summary views.

---

## In-app payment & convenience

- **UPI system integrated into the app** for ease of access.

*Verdict:* Matches **Dynamic UPI QR generator** in APP_BLUEPRINT §9.1.

---

## Fair / flexible splitting

- **For food: if someone orders more expensive and someone less**, that should be handled (unequal or itemized split).

*Verdict:* Itemized or custom split per expense; consider after core equal split is solid.

---

## Other

- **Calendar / section to plan out events** with the group (planning + expenses).
- **In-built calculator.**
- **Add the photos** (receipts) — matches **Receipt attachments** in §9.1.
- **Avoiding awkwardness** (general — aligns with product goal).
- Several responses: “Nothing” / “Nothing specific” / “You mentioned it all” / “Everything seems great.”

# Check Project Documentation

Before making significant changes or answering questions about the project, consult the documentation in `docs/` for context.

## Key References

| Document | When to check |
|----------|---------------|
| `APP_BLUEPRINT.md` | Routes, screens, data layer, design system, logic conventions, planned features |
| `docs/DATA_SPINE.md` | Data entities, mutability, storage locations, data flow |
| `docs/DATA_FLOW_TABLES.md` | Screen-to-database data mapping (SQL table format) |
| `docs/STABILIZATION.md` | System overview, execution flows, invariants, limitations, change safety |

## By Topic

| Expense edit/delete | `docs/features/EXPENSE_REVISIONS.md` |
| Receipt scanning / Firebase ML | `docs/features/RECEIPT_SCANNING_AND_ML.md` |
| Encryption | `docs/features/DATA_ENCRYPTION.md`, `docs/features/DATA_ENCRYPTION_SETUP.md` |
| Release contracts | `docs/releases/V1_RELEASE.md`, `docs/releases/V2_RELEASE.md` |
| Architecture / history | `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/architecture/DEVELOPMENT.md` |
| Known issues | `docs/internal/LOGIC_AUDIT.md` |

## Usage

- Read relevant docs before modifying core logic (settlement, cycle management, expense handling)
- Consult `STABILIZATION.md` for invariants and change safety before touching risky code paths
- Check `DATA_SPINE.md` when working with data entities to understand mutability and storage
- Check `DATA_FLOW_TABLES.md` when modifying what data screens write to the database
- Reference `APP_BLUEPRINT.md` for overall architecture decisions and planned features

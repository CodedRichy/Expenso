# Clean, Crisp Code

- **Do not add unnecessary comments.** Prefer self-explanatory names and clear structure. Only add comments when they explain *why* something non-obvious is done, not *what* the code does.
- **Avoid**: Redundant comments that restate the code, commented-out code, or long block comments for obvious logic.
- **Keep the codebase neat**: Remove dead code, avoid noise, and write concise, readable code. When editing, leave the file cleaner than you found it.

# Keep docs in sync with the app

When you **add features**, **change behavior**, or **refactor** the Expenso app:

1. **README.md** — Update so it stays accurate: e.g. "What it does", Status, stack, or any new capabilities. Keep it short and user-facing.
2. **APP_BLUEPRINT.md** — Update the relevant sections (1–8) for current implementation: routes, screens, data layer, design system, logic conventions, file layout, dependencies. If you implement something from §9 (planned features), set its Status and add a one-line "Implemented in …" if helpful.
3. **All docs in `docs/`** — Update any relevant documentation that touches the changed area. Key files to check:
   - `docs/DATA_FLOW_TABLES.md` — Update when screens, data models, or database writes change
   - `docs/DATA_SPINE.md` — Update when data entities, storage, or data flow changes
   - `docs/STABILIZATION.md` — Update when system invariants or execution flows change
   - Feature docs in `docs/features/` — Update when related feature logic changes

## "Update docs" command

When the user says **"update docs"**, review all documentation in `docs/` and root-level docs (README.md, APP_BLUEPRINT.md) to ensure they accurately reflect the current state of the codebase. Fix any outdated information, add missing details, and remove references to deprecated features.

Do not leave any documentation outdated after app changes.
